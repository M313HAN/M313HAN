# Hi, I’m Metehan 👋

I’m a Physics MSci graduate from UCL with a strong focus on **data science, machine learning, deep learning, and applied analytics**.  
I enjoy building end-to-end projects that go beyond modelling — from data ingestion and preprocessing to evaluation, interpretability, and real-world relevance.

## 🔍 Interests
- Data Science & Analytics  
- Machine Learning & Applied Statistics  
- Model reliability, uncertainty & interpretability  
- End-to-end ML pipelines (data → model → insights)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, SQL  
**ML / DS:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras
**Data & Tools:** MySQL, Git/GitHub, Jupyter, Bash/Zsh, Poetry
**Other:** LaTeX, Linux, VS Code, Pycharm

## 📌 Selected Projects
- **Colorectal Histopathology Classification**  
  Compared CNN and Vision Transformer models on 100k+ medical images, focusing on performance, calibration, interpretability, and robustness.

- **Fraud Detection Pipeline (Ongoing)**  
  Built a scalable SQL + Python pipeline on 13M+ transactions with feature engineering, imbalance handling, and explainability.

- **ML from First Principles**  
  Implemented optimisation algorithms (e.g. SGD) from scratch to understand model behaviour beyond libraries.
